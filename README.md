# Bullet-NASM-code
a derivation and update of Bullet MASM code by conversion to NASM

Compiles with commands:

   nasm barrel.asm -fbin -obarrel.com

on xubuntu 16.04 with nasm installed. 

Runs with: 

   dosbox ./barrel.com -exit
   
   The score keeping function needs more work but it almost completely works now.
