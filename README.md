# Bullet-NASM-code
A derivation and update of Bullet-MASM-code by conversion to NASM. The program now works although it is still very generic. There will be more updates soon to make the gameplay more interesting. Aug 1st, 2017.

Compiles with commands:

   nasm barrel.asm -fbin -obarrel.com

on xubuntu 16.04 with nasm installed. 

Runs with: 

   dosbox ./barrel.com -exit
